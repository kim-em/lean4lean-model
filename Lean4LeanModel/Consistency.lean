# The target theorem

Consistency of the axiom-free, inductive-free core of Lean's type theory, relative to the existence
of `ω` inaccessible cardinals -- the first model theorem toward the soundness theorem of *The
Type Theory of Lean*.

The type theory itself is the one formalized in `Lean4Lean.Theory`: `VExpr` is the term syntax,
`VEnv` the declaration environment, `CoreWF` says the environment was built by well-founded
declarations (`VDecl.WF`) without axioms or inductive declarations, and `VEnv.HasType` is the
typing judgment. Primitive quotient declarations remain in scope.

The model construction is what fills the remaining `sorry` in the consistency theorem.
General inductive declarations await the completion of `VInductDecl.WF` and `VEnv.addInduct`
upstream in lean4lean; until then their environment-extension case provides no usable information.

`∀ (α : Sort 0), α`, i.e. `∀ (p : Prop), p`.

This is the environment-independent stand-in for `False`: a `VEnv` need not contain the `False`
inductive at all, and any proof of `False` in an environment that does yields a proof of this.

There are `ω` inaccessible cardinals: a strictly increasing `ℕ`-indexed sequence of them, one to
interpret each Lean universe `Sort 0, Sort 1, ...`.

Lean itself cannot prove this: its foundations give only `v`-many inaccessibles in universe `v`
(`Cardinal.IsInaccessible.univ`), i.e. a numeral's worth for any fixed universe, never `ω` of
them in a single `Cardinal.{u}`. That gap is exactly the consistency strength the theorem below
assumes, and is why this is a hypothesis rather than a lemma.

**Consistency of the core fragment.** Assuming `ω` inaccessible cardinals, no well-formed
environment without axiom or inductive declarations proves `∀ (p : Prop), p` -- in any number
`U` of universe parameters, in the empty local context. Primitive quotient declarations are
included: they add the quotient constants and computation rule, but not `Quot.sound`.

Extending this to Lean's standard axioms (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`) also
requires pinning the standard meanings of the constants occurring in their types, including
`Eq`, `Iff`, and `Nonempty`. That awaits lean4lean's specification of inductive declarations.
